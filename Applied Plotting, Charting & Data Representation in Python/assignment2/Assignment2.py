# Before working on this assignment please read these instructions fully. In the submission area, you will notice that you can click the link to **Preview the Grading** for each step of the assignment. This is the criteria that will be used for peer grading. Please familiarize yourself with the criteria before beginning the assignment.
# 
# An NOAA dataset has been stored in the file `data/C2A2_data/BinnedCsvs_d400/fb441e62df2d58994928907a91895ec62c2c42e6cd075c2700843b89.csv`. This is the dataset to use for this assignment. Note: The data for this assignment comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Daily Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt) (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.
# 
# Each row in the assignment datafile corresponds to a single observation.
# 
# The following variables are provided to you:
# 
# * **id** : station identification code
# * **date** : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
# * **element** : indicator of element type
#     * TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
#     * TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
# * **value** : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)
# 
# For this assignment, you must:
# 
# 1. Read the documentation and familiarize yourself with the dataset, then write some python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded.
# 2. Overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
# 3. Watch out for leap days (i.e. February 29th), it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for the purpose of this visualization.
# 4. Make the visual nice! Leverage principles from the first module in this course when developing your solution. Consider issues such as legends, labels, and chart junk.
# 
# The data you have been given is near **Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States**, and the stations the data comes from are shown on the map below.
